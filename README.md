# Demo_notebooks
A repo for demo notebooks of various tools and techniques I've explored. The idea is to have the notebooks demonstrate the basics of a tool/library/whatever and also contain links to documentation and other resources.

## Contents:

- [Introducing Groq](Groq_demo.ipynb) - A short Colab notebook introduction to the Groq inference platform.
